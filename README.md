# X-Plane yaw string plugin

X-Plane 11 does not offer a view with full screen with no cockpit output with yaw string.

Yaw string is mandatory for glider pilots.

So I decided to do the needful.

WIP - Does not work yet.

Code based on X-Plane 11 Instanced Drawing Sample found here: https://developer.x-plane.com/code-sample/instanced-drawing-sample/
